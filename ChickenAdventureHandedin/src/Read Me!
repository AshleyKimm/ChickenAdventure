Brief explanation 


	Bean.java
		- The beans appear on the same x-axis (same y value), but random y-axis (random x value)
		
	Chicken.java & Skateboard.java
		- The user can only move the chicken horizontally
		
	Rain.java
		- Array of images are created for different shades of individual raindrops
		- The raindrops are randomly positioned within 0 to 200 y value to avoid straight line of raindrops falling
		
	Seed.java
		- Positioned at random x value, and travels straight downward
		- Once it gets to the bottom of the game window, it is positioned at the very top (y = 0)
		
Codes that did not work


GameController.java: line 107 to 110
	- I wanted make the chicken face the way it goes, so I downloaded two images of chicken: one facing
	the right and one facing the left -
	(When the input array gets "RIGHT", then it displays the image of chicken facing right, vice versa)
	It did not work, so I added an image of a skateboard so that even when the chicken moves left while facing
	right, it would look less awkward than making it look like it's moving backwards.
	
application.css - line 21 to 24
	- Since I learned how to apply fonts to string, I wanted to apply the fonts to buttons as well. I searched up 
	how it can be done by using application.css. I wrote '@font-face' with 'font-family' and its url, and wrote the
	font-family name for a startButton which did not work. 
	
New things I learned


	- I learned how to change the scenes: I tried the method that Mr. Holik posted but it did not work. It was
	because the controller method that I had had a gameLoop() method that is usually called in the Main class.
	Since the Main class for javafx project that uses gameLoop() and the ones that don't use gameLoop() is 
	different, I learned to modify the changing scene method so that it calls the gameLoop() method of its controller.
	
	- For all the BorderPane that are used in this game has canvases. I thought I could add a button (or any other 
	JavaFX controls), but I couldn't. I researched, and I learned that I had to put the canvas inside 
	AnchorPane in order to add other controls to the canvas. 

Features

	- The start scene displays two buttons: 'START' button and 'HOW TO PLAY' button. 'START' button allows the user
	to start the game by changing the scene to game scene, and 'HOW TO PLAY' button changes the scene to HowToPlay scene
	which displays the instructions to play the game.
	- The game scene has a 'MENU' button, and 'RESTART' button. Both buttons reset the score and speed when clicked.
	- At the end of the game, it stores the current score and compares it with the previous score to display the highscore.
	
Instructions
	- The user uses RIGHT/LEFT keys to move the chicken.
	- When it collides with raindrop, its lives decrease by 1.
	- When it collides with a seed, its speed increases by 0.5.
	- When it collides with a bean, its score increases by 1.
	- The raindrops' speed increase by 0.5 after every 5 beans are collected.
	- The number of raindrops increase by 1 after every 6 beans are collected.
	- The goal is to collect as many beans as possible without colliding with raindrops.
