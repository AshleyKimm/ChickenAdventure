Chicken Adventure Game

Once the game starts, the user uses the arrow keys (left and right) to move the chicken.

If the chicken touches the water drops - its life reduces by 1.
The chicken can speed up by collecting the beans.
The goal is to collect as many eggs as possible before the three lives get used up!
